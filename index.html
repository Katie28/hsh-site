                <p>HSH Holdings International, Inc. is a new real estate development and management company established for that purpose and intended to provide investors with access and exposure to the rapidly expanding and ever growing Bahamian luxury real estate market. The principals and executive management of HSH have been involved in real estate development collectively for over 100 years and specifically with the primary assets of HSH for over eight years.</p>

<p>In 2007 and 2008, our group successfully acquired 700 acres of pristine beachfront property along the eastern coast of the island of Abaco in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The acquisition included 300 +/- acres at Conch Sound Point and 400 +/- acres at High Bank Bay. Immediately following the acquisition, the approval process was granted for a Resort development.</p>

<p>Our passion for this property continues to drive us to create a place rich with influences of British heritage and times long since past. The two parcels present over two miles of white sand beach with over five miles of open beach to the north and south, waiting to be embraced. The lighthouse at the southern tip of Abaco is rich with history and presents an opportunity for exploration and adoration. Combine this with the natural beauty of the coastline, the distinct sounds and enchanting encounters with the Abaco parrot, and you have true paradise.</p>

<p>Our mission… to create a place so private and intimate, that it captures your heart and spirit allowing you to forget that hurried lifestyle. </p>

<p>The Vision…for you to experience a place so naturally peaceful, serene and untouched that every moment is a captured image never to forget. All that is missing is you!</p>

<p>Embrace this Opportunity and come visit us at <span class="abaco">The Island Ranches at the South of Abaco.</span></p>

AUTHORIZED USERS
Eligibility
The Services and the Site cannot be used by individuals less than least 18 years old.

Accordingly, Users are required to complete a questionnaire to determine whether or not they are “accredited investors”. HSH relies entirely on representations made by such Users and while we reserve the right to perform background checks and other information verification steps in order to confirm the veracity of any User's responses to the questionnaire, we are under no obligation to do so. Therefore, HSH does not represent that any User is an “accredited investor”. HSH may require Users to recertify their “accredited investor” status from time to time. HSH may change eligibility criteria for the Service at any time, without notice. This provision is void where prohibited by law, and the right to access the Service is revoked in any such jurisdiction.
